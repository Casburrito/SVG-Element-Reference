<!-- This filter primitive performs the combination of two input images pixel-wise in
image space using one of the Porter-Duff compositing operations: over, in, atop,
out, xor and lighter. Additionally, a component-wise arithmetic operation (with the
result clamped between [0..1]) can be applied. The arithmetic operation is useful
for combining the output from the <feDiffuseLighting> and <feSpecularLighting>
filters with texture data. If the arithmetic operation is chosen, each result pixel
is computed using the following formula:

result = k1*i1*i2 + k2*i1 + k3*i2 + k4

where:

- i1 and i2 indicate the corresponding pixel channel values of the input
  image, which map to in and in2 respectively
- k1, k2, k3 and k4 indicate the values
  of the attributes with the same name -->
