<!-- The HTML <audio> element is used to embed sound content in documents. It may contain
one or more audio sources, represented using the src attribute or the <source>
element; the browser will choose the most suitable one.

Fallback content for browsers not supporting the <audio> element can be added too,
inside the opening and closing <audio></audio> tags.

The most basic playback functionality can be made available using the controls
attribute (see below); for more advanced usage, audio playback and controls can
be manipulated using the HTML Media API, and more specifically the features defined
in the HTMLAudioElement interface.

You can also use the Web Audio API to directly generate and manipulate audio streams
from JavaScript code. See Web Audio API for details.

Permitted content: If the element has a src attribute: zero or more <track> elements,
followed by transparent content that contains no media elements â€” that is, no <audio>
or <video> elements.

Else: zero or more <source> elements, followed by zero or more <track> elements,
followed by transparent content that contains no media elements, that is no <audio>
or <video> elements. -->

<!-- This element includes the global attributes.

autoplay:
  A Boolean attribute; if specified (even if the value is "false"!), the audio will
  automatically begin playback as soon as it can do so, without waiting for the
  entire audio file to finish downloading.

autobuffer (Obsolete since Gecko 2.0):
  A Boolean attribute; if specified, the audio will automatically begin being downloaded,
  even if not set to autoplay. This continues until the media cache is full, or the entire
  audio file has been downloaded, whichever comes first. This should only be used when it
  is expected that the user will choose to play the audio; for example, if the user has
  navigated to a page using a "Play this audio" link. This attribute was removed in Gecko
  2.0 (Firefox 4 / Thunderbird 3.3 / SeaMonkey 2.1) in favor of the preload attribute.

buffered:
  An attribute you can read to determine which time ranges of the media have been buffered.
  This attribute contains a TimeRanges object.

controls:
  If this attribute is present, the browser will offer controls to allow the user to
  control audio playback, including volume, seeking, and pause/resume playback.

loop:
  A Boolean attribute; if specified, will automatically seek back to the start upon reaching
  the end of the audio.


mozCurrentSampleOffset:
  The offset, specified as the number of samples since the beginning of the audio stream,
  at which the audio is currently playing.

muted:
  A Boolean attribute which indicates whether the audio will be initially silenced. Its
  default value is false.

played:
  A TimeRanges object indicating all the ranges of the audio that have been played.

preload:
  This enumerated attribute is intended to provide a hint to the browser about what the
  author thinks will lead to the best user experience. It may have one of the following values:
    - none: indicates that the audio should not be preloaded;
    - metadata: indicates that only audio metadata (e.g. length) is fetched;
    - auto: indicates that the whole audio file could be downloaded, even if the user is
      not expected to use it;
    - the empty string: synonym of the auto value.
  If not set, its default value is browser-defined (i.e. each browser may have its own
  default value). The spec advises it to be set to metadata.

  Usage notes:
      - The autoplay attribute has precedence over preload. If autoplay is specified, the browser
        would obviously need to start downloading the audio for playback.
      - The browser is not forced by the specification to follow the value of this attribute;
        it is a mere hint.

src:
  The URL of the audio to embed. This is subject to HTTP access controls. This is optional;
  you may instead use the <source> element within the audio block to specify the audio to embed.

volume:
  The playback volume, in the range 0.0 (silent) to 1.0 (loudest).

  Time offsets are specified as float values indicating the number of seconds to offset.

  Note: The time offset value definition has not yet been completed in the HTML5 specification
  and is subject to change. -->
